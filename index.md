# GeoMop

Toolbox for preparation and running complex hydrogeological simulations
in particular using [Flow123d](https://flow123d.github.io) simulator of
transport processes in the fractured porous media.
Components:

 - **Layers** - preparation of layered computational geometry from the GIS data
 - **Model Editor** - editor of the main Flow123d input file in YAML format
 - **Jobs Panel** - running and management of job on distributed computational resources
 - **Analysis** - arrangement of complex computing scenarios
